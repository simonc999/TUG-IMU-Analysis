# TUG-IMU Analysis

**Timed Up and Go (TUG) test signal-processing toolbox for MATLABÂ®**

> Rapid extraction of mobility metrics (sit-to-stand, gait cycles, step count, total time) from raw inertial measurements recorded at â‰ˆ100Â Hz with a LifeSignal/Antelope smartâ€‘shirt or any IMU exported in the same HDF5 layout.

## ðŸ“¦ Repository overview

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `life_importfile.m` | Lowâ€‘level HDF5 reader that loads accelerometer, gyroscope & magnetometer channels and returns them as doubleâ€‘precision matrices together with a POSIXâ€‘derived `datetime` vector. |
| `sorgente.m` | **Main analysis pipeline** â€“ filters the signals, detects artefacts, segments the TUG phases *(sit â†” stand, walking, turning)*, counts steps and produces publicationâ€‘ready plots. |
| `untitled.m` | Experimental scratchpad for algorithm prototyping â€“ kept for reference. |
| `TUGÂ test.h5` | Example dataset (â‰ˆ100Â Hz, 98Â s) to let you try the pipeline outâ€‘ofâ€‘theâ€‘box. |

## Quick start

1. **Clone** the repo and open it in **MATLABÂ®Â R2022b or later** (earlier releases will probably work too).  
2. Install the *Signal Processing Toolbox* (only dependency).  
3. Run:

```matlab
>> sorgente              % analysis & plots
```

4. Inspect the figures, or adapt the code to export the metrics to CSV/JSON.

## How it works

1. **Import**  
   `life_importfile.m` reads the threeâ€‘axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer streams (`/ACCELEROMETER_3D/â€¦/x/v`) together with their timestamps and converts them into SI units.

2. **Preâ€‘processing**  
   A movingâ€‘average filter (window size adjustable in the script) smooths the raw data; gravity is removed from the accelerometer signal.

3. **Phase segmentation & events**  
   Thresholdâ€‘based logic on the xâ€‘axis gyroscope identifies:  
   - Start of **sitâ€‘toâ€‘stand**  
   - End of **standâ€‘toâ€‘sit**  
   Turning points are detected via envelope peaks.

4. **Step counting**  
   Peaks in the highâ€‘pass filtered envelope of the accelerometer modulus yield the number of gait cycles.

5. **Output & visualisation**  
   The script produces stacked timeâ€‘series plots annotated with the detected events and prints a concise summary in the command window *(total TUG time, steps, cadence, stride time).*

## Configuration

| Parameter | Location | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `k` | `life_importfile.m` | `4` | Stdâ€‘dev multiplier for the gyroscope event threshold. |
| `win` | `sorgente.m` | `15` samples | Movingâ€‘average window length. |
